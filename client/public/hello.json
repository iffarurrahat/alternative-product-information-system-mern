    "recommendation_reason": "Investigations have revealed that the brand's manufacturing facilities employ child labor and subject workers to poor working conditions. Despite being marketed as ethically produced, the brand has failed to ensure fair wages and safe working environments for its workers. This exploitation is a significant reason to boycott the brand and support more transparent and ethical clothing companies.",

    "recommendation_reason": "Although the brand promotes itself as cruelty-free, investigations have shown otherwise. The farms supplying the plant-based milk have been found to use harmful pesticides and fertilizers, causing environmental damage and health risks to farmworkers. These unethical practices contradict the brand's cruelty-free image and mislead consumers. Boycotting this brand supports truly ethical farming practices.",
